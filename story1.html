        <h3>Why Animals Are Better Friends</h3>
        <p> We live in such a complicated society today, driven by human ideals, that it is easy to overlook the contribution and impact that the natural world has on us. The natural world bestowed onto us the greatest gift we could ever receive, animals. The relationship between humans and animals is the perfect and superior form of friendship.
          <br>
          <br>
          I often compare the way my dog greets me after being gone for five minutes to the way my friends greet me after not seeing me for weeks. The joy in my dog's eyes can only be described as unconditional love. The wagging tail, the loud barking, and the wiggling butt say more than any words spoken. Their affection is not contingent on my social status, appearance, or financial means. The way my dog loves me inspires me to love unconditionally. 
          <br>
          <br>
          While humans struggle to communicate their feelings, animals have no ego and may do so freely.  Animals have simple feelings that they can communicate simply and quickly. They have no resentment and cannot belittle.  In comparison to the emotional resistance that people are capable of, their communication is straightforward and honest. There is no hidden meaning in the way animals interact with their owners. It helps us to connect on a deeper level without using words.
          <br>
          <br>
          In a world of commercialization and digital dependence, we are exposed to many things that undermine our egos and individual ideals. Animals do not reflect societal attitudes. Beyond the bark, there is no judgment. Every pet provides a secure environment for you to be yourself without criticism or prejudice.
          <br>
          <br>
          The simplicity of their nature, I believe, is what makes animal connections superior to human friendships. Animal friendships are founded on unconditional love, acceptance, and a lack of judgment. I encourage everyone to find their four-legged best friend.
