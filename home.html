            I am very commited to making a difference in this world. We live in a busy society, with everyone focused on consumerism and matierials, I hope to open your eyes to the beauty of life's smallest details. Every day is a new day to learn something! I encourage everyone to think about something small in their life that brings them joy and how they could show case that to others. I am all about sharing positivity!

            The goal of this website is not only to showcase my skills and projects, but I want to inspire others to think more! I want to inspire others to think about their own passions and how they can share that with the world! Currently, I am exploring the world of opertations management!
